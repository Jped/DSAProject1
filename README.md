# DSAProject1
First Project in DSA I @ The Cooper Union
This is the first project from Professor Sable's Data Strutures and Algorithms Course at Cooper Union.
The purpose of this project is to implement a template for a stack and queue that can read commands from an input file
that add different elements to a specified stack or queue of its type. 
I recieved a 100 on this project.
